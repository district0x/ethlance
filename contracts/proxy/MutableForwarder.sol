 * @dev For TCR Registry contracts (Registry.sol, ParamChangeRegistry.sol) we use mutable forwarders instead of using
 * contracts directly. This is for better upgradeability. Since registry contracts fire all events related to registry
 * entries, we want to be able to access whole history of events always on the same address. Which would be address of
 * a MutableForwarder. When a registry contract is replaced with updated one, mutable forwarder just replaces target
 * and all events stay still accessible on the same address.
